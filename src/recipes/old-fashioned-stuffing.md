# Old Fashioned Bread Stuffing

Inspired from "Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook"

- 1 cup finely chopped celery
- 3/4 -1 cup chopped onion
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter or margarine
- 2 teaspoons poultry season (I use Bell's)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1 large loaf of white bread, torn
- 1 to 2 cups of chicken broth
 
In a saucepan, cook celery and onion in butter till tender but not brown. Remove from heat and stir in poultry seasoning or sage, salt and pepper. Place the dry bread cubes in a large mixing bowl. Add the onion mixture. Mix thoroughly. Drizzle with enough broth or water to moisten.. 
 
This is normally used to stuff a bird.  It doesn't say how to cook in a baking dish.  I would say maybe 375 degrees for at least 20-30 minutes in a buttered baking dish. Maybe first half of time covered, second half uncovered (so it doesn't get too brown).
